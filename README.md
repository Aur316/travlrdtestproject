Travlrd Test Project
Overview
This project is a demonstration of a full-stack application built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Next UI. The application integrates with Airtable and Supabase to provide a seamless two-way synchronization of data between these platforms. The data is then displayed in a visually appealing manner using card components on the frontend.
